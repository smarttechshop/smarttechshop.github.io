<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>TrendStoreUSA Rewards TRIAL AND SUBSCRIPTION TERMS</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>TrendStoreUSA Rewards. Company offers a subscription membership (TrendStoreUSA Rewards</span><span>), which provides access to&nbsp;</span><span>[premium discounts, exclusive offers, and insider content, and free shipping on certain items</span><span>, according to these Terms and as displayed to you at the time you enrolled.

<p><span>Free&nbsp;</span><span>14</span><span>&nbsp;Day Trial Period. If you enrol in a free trial period for the TrendStoreUSA Rewards</span><span>, you are not charged for</span><span>&nbsp;14</span><span>&nbsp;days from the date of purchase for the subscription membership (you will be charged for any physical products that you purchase). However, you will be required to provide payment information to pay for the TrendStoreUSA Rewards</span><span>&nbsp;fees, including any taxes, which will be due once the trial period ends, unless you cancel as outlined below.

By providing a credit card or other payment method, including through the checkout process, express checkout, or using PayPal, Google Pay,Apple Pay, or otherwise, you warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method and authorize Company and any third-party payment processors and billing agents to charge your payment method for the total amount due.

<ol>
<li><span>DISPUTE RESOLUTION&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>Governing Law and Venue. Subject to and without waiving the arbitration provision below, this Agreement shall be exclusively governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the&nbsp;</span><span>U.S.</span><span>&nbsp;without regard to its conflict of law principles, and the proper venue for any judicial action arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be the state and federal courts located in Ireland</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>(a “Court of Competent Jurisdiction”). You and Company stipulate to, and waive any objection to, the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and submit to extraterritorial service of process. If you reside outside the U.S. and bring a Claim against Company outside the U.S., applicable laws may authorize you to bring a Claim against Company, which shall be brought in your individual capacity only and not in any class action, in the forum where you reside.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Arbitration Provision. If you and Company cannot resolve a Claim through informal negotiations, any Claim shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. “Claim(s)” means any claim or dispute between the parties and/or their parents, subsidiaries, affiliated entities or persons, employees, agents, members, partners, officers, owners, managers, directors, independent contractors, manufacturers, licensors, beneficiaries, successors, and/or assigns, and each of their owners and/or agents (collectively, “Company Entities” who shall be third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement where referenced) arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Service. This arbitration provision is reciprocal, and any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. This arbitration provision, including the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.</span></p>
<p><span>The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted through JAMS (www.jamsadr.com) under its Streamlined Rules, as modified by this arbitration provision. The parties shall each participate in the selection of a neutral arbitrator pursuant to the Streamlined Rules. If JAMS is unavailable to arbitrate, you and Company agree to arbitrate using an alternative arbitral forum. All remedies available to the parties under applicable laws shall remain available in arbitration. All issues, including the interpretation and enforceability of this arbitration provision, shall be determined by the arbitrator. Unless you and Company agree otherwise in writing, the final arbitration hearing shall take place in person at the JAMS facility located in or nearest to your city of residence, provided that either party may elect to have the arbitration conducted by video conference or telephone. If you initiate arbitration against Company, you will be required to pay an initial fee of $250 (unless you qualify for a waiver), and all other arbitration costs (including any remaining Case Management Fee and fees for the arbitrator’s services) shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator. If Company initiates arbitration against you, Company shall pay all costs associated with the arbitration. Regardless, you and Company will each pay your own attorney’s fees and costs unless an award of attorney’s fees is available under applicable statute.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The arbitrator’s award will consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each Claim. The award will also provide a concise written statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Either party may seek relief in a Court of Competent Jurisdiction to stay proceedings pending arbitration, to modify, confirm, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator, or for injunctive relief in aid of arbitration. You agree that without this provision, you would have the right to sue in court with a jury trial.</span></p>
<p><span>Waiver of Class Actions.

</ol>
<p><span>Application. This Section applies to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws. Some jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of certain damages, so some of the below terms may not apply to you.

No advice or information obtained by you through the Service or otherwise shall alter the terms stated in this Section.</span></p>
<p><span>Disclaimer of Warranties.

THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE LOSS OR DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY OR FORM OF ACTION. YOU AGREE THAT THIS SECTION REPRESENTS A REASONABLE ALLOCATION OF RISK AND IS A FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN COMPANY AND YOU.
